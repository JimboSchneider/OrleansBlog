# OrleansBlog

A blog application built with .NET Blazor Server and Microsoft Orleans Framework. This project demonstrates the use of Orleans' grain-based architecture for scalable, distributed state management in a real-world blog application.

## Current Status
**Functional Blog Platform** - Core blog functionality is implemented with Orleans grains, including post creation, viewing, and comprehensive testing.

## Technology Stack
- **.NET 9.0** - Latest .NET version
- **Blazor Server** - Interactive web UI with server-side rendering
- **Microsoft Orleans 9.1.2** - Actor-based distributed computing framework
- **Entity Framework Core 9.0** - ORM for data access
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** - Authentication and authorization
- **SQLite** - Database for development (SQL Server supported for production)

## Architecture
The solution follows a clean architecture pattern with the following projects:

- **OrleansBlog** - Blazor Server web application (UI layer)
- **OrleansBlog.Abstractions** - Grain interfaces and domain models
- **OrleansBlog.Grains** - Orleans grain implementations (business logic)
- **OrleansBlog.Silo** - Orleans host/runtime
- **OrleansBlog.Tests** - Comprehensive unit tests with Orleans TestingHost
- **OrleansBlog.E2E.Tests** - End-to-end tests with Playwright for UI testing

## Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- SQLite (for development) or SQL Server (for production)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OrleansBlog.git
cd OrleansBlog
```

### 2. Build the solution
```bash
dotnet build
```

### 3. Run tests (optional)
```bash
# Unit tests
dotnet test OrleansBlog.Tests

# End-to-end tests (requires Silo and Blazor app to be running)
# First start the Silo and Blazor app (see steps 4 & 5), then:
dotnet test OrleansBlog.E2E.Tests
```

### 4. Run the Orleans Silo (required first)
In one terminal:
```bash
cd OrleansBlog.Silo
dotnet run
```

### 5. Run the Blazor Web Application
In another terminal:
```bash
cd OrleansBlog
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at:
- HTTP: http://localhost:5261
- HTTPS: https://localhost:7233

## Using the Blog

### Creating Posts
1. Register a new account or log in with an existing account
2. Navigate to the "New Post" link in the navigation menu (only visible when authenticated)
3. Fill out the post form with title, content, and optional tags (comma-separated)
4. Submit to create the post using Orleans grains for distributed state management

### Viewing Posts
- Recent posts are displayed on the home page
- Click any post title to view the full post content
- Posts show creation date, tags, and formatted content

### Authentication
- User registration and login powered by ASP.NET Core Identity
- Only authenticated users can create posts
- User data stored in SQLite database

## Development Notes

### Database
- Development uses SQLite for simplicity (`orleans-blog.db` file)
- Database is automatically created on first run
- Connection string can be configured in `appsettings.Development.json`

### Running in Background
To run the silo without console interaction:
```bash
cd OrleansBlog.Silo
ORLEANS_NO_WAIT=true dotnet run
```

### Viewing SQLite Database
```bash
# List tables
sqlite3 orleans-blog.db ".tables"

# View data
sqlite3 orleans-blog.db "SELECT * FROM AspNetUsers;"
```

## CI/CD and Testing

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The project includes automated build validation for pull requests targeting the `main` branch:

- **Multi-OS Testing**: Runs on both Ubuntu and Windows to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- **Full Build Process**: Builds all projects in Release configuration
- **E2E Test Automation**: Infrastructure ready to automatically start Orleans Silo and Blazor Server (currently disabled pending test stability improvements)
- **NuGet Package Caching**: Speeds up builds by caching dependencies
- **Enhanced Service Management**: Improved process startup reliability with proper error handling and logging
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Uses PowerShell Core for consistent behavior across Windows and Linux
- **Smart Build Triggering**: Documentation-only changes (*.md files, LICENSE, etc.) do not trigger builds to save CI/CD resources

### Running E2E Tests Locally
E2E tests use Playwright for browser automation and require both the Orleans Silo and Blazor app to be running:

```bash
# 1. Start Orleans Silo (in terminal 1)
cd OrleansBlog.Silo
dotnet run

# 2. Start Blazor app (in terminal 2)
cd OrleansBlog
dotnet run

# 3. Run E2E tests (in terminal 3)
dotnet test OrleansBlog.E2E.Tests
```
